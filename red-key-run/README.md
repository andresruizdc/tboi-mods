Starting Room Red Key on Pedestal
A simple mod to add a Red Key pedestal to your starting floor, starting room.

I just find the red key incredibly fun to use and traveling and more rooms to abuse to be stupid and fun but its so rare and most times you get it way late and I know its essentially a long burn OP item but meh.
Anyway, if someone could make that as a simple mod you'd be amazing. Pedestal means any character or could be entirely skipped and just gives an option on how youd like to try your run.
