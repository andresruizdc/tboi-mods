# The Binding of Isaac andrdc Mods

## Getting started
[The Binding of Isaac Docs](https://wofsauge.github.io/IsaacDocs/)

You'll need a [copy](https://store.steampowered.com/bundle/2405/The_Binding_of_Isaac_Rebirth_Complete_Bundle/) of the game. Then refer to the docs to make the initial setup.

In the playground directory you'll find small scripts to do funny things, just
play with it.

Some of these mods are from the [Lyte tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMZJyHSWa_My5DDoTQcKCgs475xIpQHSF)
