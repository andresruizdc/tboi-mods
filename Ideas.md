- ### Item Idea: Idle Hands by Captain Drunkbutt
Idle Hands
The Devil's playground
(passive, quality 3)
Item pools: Secret, Red Chest, Demon Beggar (?)

Isaac can no longer hold cards, runes, pills, ect. Instead, they will be used immediately upon picking them up, and will have the effects of their horse/reverse counterparts (not sure what to do with souls, runes and playing cards).
Example: Balls of Steel will give four soul hearts, The Hierophant will drop two bone hearts.
Either that or all future pills and tarot cards are replaced with horse pills and reverse cards respectively.
Not sure if it's possible, but they should synergize with Tarot Cloth, Echo Chamber, Placebo and Blank Card, Starter Deck and Little Baggy, Deck of Cards and Mum's Bottle, and probably some more that I've left out.

- ### Item Idea: Reincarnation by Nadi
The item would be a 1 time use active item, it would get rid if everything you've done in a run and completely replace it.
You would be placed on a random floor with a random number of items with a random character etc.
